This repository contains the files and materials supporting my studies at Central European University in the **Data Scince 2 course**.

### Assignment 1
Contains predictive models aiming to get which of two different juices is chosen in a given purchase situation, predict sales and whether patients actually show up for their medical appointments. For this I built lasso, random forest, gradient boosting and also stacked models. 

### Assignment 2
